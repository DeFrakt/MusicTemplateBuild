### Small Write up

  1. What you technologies you used and why 

  Used the technologies provided for the test. Bootstrap was the easiest and best suited for a quick grid system build. Adding any more frameworks or technologies would over complicate for a single page application such as this, in my opinion. 

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

  Cross Browser support. Looks great in Google Chrome, needs small adjustments in Firefox, Safari, IE. 

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why

  I enjoyed all the little small challenges of aligning pictures, to adding color, and images where needed--As well as making the webpage responsive to mobile devices. I would stil go a further with the mobile design so that it's more true to wireframe and fluid for users.
